# Database Fix Summary

## Problem

The MindfulWealth application encountered a database schema issue when trying to add a new `email` column with a UNIQUE constraint to the existing `users` table. This resulted in the following error:

```
sqlite3.OperationalError: Cannot add a UNIQUE column
```

## Solution Steps

We implemented a comprehensive solution to address this issue:

### 1. Improved Migration Script

We updated the `migrate_db.py` script to:
- Use a table recreation approach instead of ALTER TABLE
- Preserve existing data during schema changes
- Add proper error handling with transaction support
- Create backups before migrations
- Handle field name discrepancies between frontend and backend

### 2. Field Name Compatibility

We identified and addressed field name discrepancies between the frontend and backend:
- In the `SavedImpulse` model, the backend uses `description` while the frontend expects `item`
- In the `SavedImpulse` model, the backend uses `projected_value_1yr` while the frontend expects `potential_value`

We implemented a solution that:
1. Detects tables with inconsistent field names
2. Recreates these tables with the correct schema
3. Maps data from old field names to new field names during migration
4. Updates API endpoints to accept both naming conventions

### 3. Created Fix Database Script

We created a `fix_database.sh` script that:
- Backs up the current database
- Runs the migration script
- Initializes the database with the updated schema
- Creates demo users if needed

### 4. Enhanced Documentation

We added comprehensive documentation:
- Updated the README with database migration information
- Created detailed database schema documentation
- Added a migration issue resolution document
- Documented common database errors and solutions

### 5. Updated Setup Process

We updated the setup process to:
- Run database migrations during setup
- Check for database issues and fix them automatically
- Provide clear error messages for database-related issues

## Results

The solution successfully:
1. Fixed the immediate issue with the UNIQUE constraint
2. Preserved existing user data during the migration
3. Established a robust process for handling future schema changes
4. Provided clear documentation for troubleshooting database issues

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Modified Files**:
   - `backend/migrate_db.py`: Updated to use table recreation approach
   - `README.md`: Added database migration information
   - `setup.sh`: Updated to run migrations during setup

2. **Created Files**:
   - `fix_database.sh`: Script to fix database issues
   - `docs/database_schema.md`: Detailed database schema documentation
